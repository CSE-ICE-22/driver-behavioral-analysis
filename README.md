Analyse habits of drivers using data collected from vehicle OBD port

### Description:
This project analyzes driver habits by collecting real-time data from a vehicle's OBD-II port. Parameters like speed, RPM, throttle position, and braking patterns are gathered using a Bluetooth OBD adapter and smartphone. Machine learning models process this data to classify driving behavior (e.g., safe, aggressive, or risky). The goal is to provide feedback that promotes safer, more efficient driving and supports applications like insurance risk profiling and fleet management.

#### Key Features:
- Real-time OBD-II data logging
- Driving behavior classification using ML
- Feedback for driver awareness
